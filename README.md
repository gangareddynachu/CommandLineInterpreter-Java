# CommandLineInterpreter-Java


We have implemented a command line interpreter using Java.
We have used two Modes of operating the shell.
Interactive
Batch

The Interactive Mode is implemented by the while loop which executes commands one by one as per the input given by the user and it only comes out of the loop when the user enters the quit or ctrl+D  command .

For the batch mode ,we have given multiple commands  at the prompt  separated by the semicolon (;). We are able to execute the commands one by one and these commands are separated by the semicolon(;).
